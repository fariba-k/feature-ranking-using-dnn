# feature-ranking-using-dnn

This repository contains the base approach of a [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3307339.3342139) I published  in 2019 which you can refer to for more details and the math behind it.

The idea is to use the weight matrices of a trained network to rank features and find most important features for each class.

In this repository, I implemented a simplified version and tested it on MNIST digit dataset.
